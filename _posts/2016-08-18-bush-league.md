  72 minute documentary Bush League is a character driven ethnographic survey of
  a tiny village in Northern Malawi. Intimate dramas unfold in the lives of four
  villagers who are all members of the local soccer team. Chatwa, the team
  captain, is an ambitious farmer who's in deep with the local bank but
  torrential rains are destroying his crops.
